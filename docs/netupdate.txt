Assuming the state consists of (grid, event), should the q-value be updated when
either s or s' in (s, a, r, s', a') contains an END event, or when either a or
a' is None?

Intuitively, the network should yield the q-values for assigning each channel
given a grid and cell; that is, the event is assumed to be a NEW/HOFF event.
Because the network is used in a feed-forward manner for reassignment on END
events, perhaps the network should be ignorant of whether channels are available
or not in the given cell; only the neighbors matter. This hypothesis might be
tested by comparing the q-values for two equal grids fed through the network,
only differing on the availability of one channel in the given cell.

Another approach is to modify the grid such that all channels in the given cell
are free when sending it through the network for END events, in order to mimick
assigning a new channel. This leaves two options for training: don't train on
END events, or do the same to the grid when training.
