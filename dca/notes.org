Actor-critic, Policy Gradients Etc.

In Future: Distributed system with multiple agents. Cooperation, competition,
sharing of parameters?

Thesis notes:
For the memory-less traffic modelled in the simulator, a RL-compatible model
can be derived by using the fact that a) the minimum of several exponentially
distributed is itself exp. dist. with some parameter, and b) given an action,
the next allocation map is deterministic and hence the reward is deterministic.
However, as previously discussed, this model might not be representable for real-world
traffic and so this approach could only be used in simulation and 
not in a deployed system.

dont want to do decision time planning or rollouts, eg mtcs, in deploed sys
because of response time

for lagging qnet, specify which net is used to selection actions which are executed
and why this net and not the other is used

"Instead of updating the target network periodically and 
all at once, we will be updating it frequently, but slowly. 
This technique was introduced in another DeepMind paper1509.02971.pdf
 earlier this year, where they found that it stabilized the training process.
